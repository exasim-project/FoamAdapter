# FoamAdapter

FoamAdapter provides platform-portable implementations of common CFD algorithms and solvers using
[NeoN](https://github.com/exasim-project/NeoN) as a computational backend.
Additionally, It implements converters between OpenFOAM and NeoN datastructures such that you can run examples, benchmarks and tests on accelerator devices.

## Requirements

FoamAdapter has the following requirements

*  _cmake 3.22+_
*  _gcc >= 12_ or  _clang >= 18+_
* OpenFOAM _2406_+
* CUDA  _12.1_ (for GPU support)

## Compilation

We provide several Cmake presets to set commmonly required flags for building FoamAdapter

    cmake --list-presets # To list existing presets
    cmake --preset production # Config for production
    cmake --build --preset production # Build for production

## Structure

The repository is structured in the following way:
- src and include implement common functionality to copy data between OpenFOAM and NeoN
- tests demonstrating that FoamAdapter and OpenFOAM deliver identical results are provided by this repository in the test folder.
- examples provides examples of how FoamAdapter and FoamAdapter can be used for writing applications
- tutorials provides tutorial cases which can be run like typical OpenFOAM cases
