Getting started
===============

You can build FoamAdapter by following these steps:

Clone the FoamAdapter repository including FoamAdapter integrated as a submodule:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/exasim-project/FoamAdapter.git

Navigate to the FoamAdapter directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd FoamAdapter

FoamAdapter uses CMake to build, thus the standard CMake procedure should work, however, we recommend using one of the provided CMake presets detailed below `below <Building with CMake Presets>`_. From a build directory, you can execute:

   .. code-block:: bash

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake <DesiredBuildFlags> ..
        cmake --build .
        cmake --install .

Building with CMake Presets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additionally, we provide several CMake presets to set commonly required flags if you compile NeoFoam in combination with Kokkos.

   .. code-block:: bash

    cmake --list-presets # To list existing presets

To build FoamAdapter for production use, you can use the following commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

    cmake --preset production # To configure with ninja and common kokkos flags
    cmake --build --preset production # To compile with ninja and common kokkos flags

It should be noted that the build directory changes depending on the chosen preset. This way you can have different build directories for different presets and easily switch between them.
